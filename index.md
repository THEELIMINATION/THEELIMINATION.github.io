## My blog

Heya, welcome to my blog!

Today I'm gonna be critiquing a website recommended to me by many of my teachers. I simply cannot understand how they tolerate this. 
The website is called "citationmachine" and I have a problem with this messy unorganized piece of... crap.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/THEELIMINATION/THEELIMINATION.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
