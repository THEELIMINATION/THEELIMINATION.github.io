## My blog

Heya, welcome to my blog!

Today I'm gonna be critiquing a website recommended to me by many of my teachers. I simply cannot understand how they tolerate this. 
The website is called ["citationmachine"](http://www.citationmachine.net) and I have a problem with this messy unorganized piece of... crap.

### Security

Let's start out soft. My first major gripe with this site is the lack of HTTPS in 2019. 
We're living in a time where you can charge your phone without wires, where you can play incredible things—even in VR—on your phone!
So someone please, please _please_ tell me why in the world you haven't secured your website. It's cheap and easy.
HSTS and HTTPS are an absolute must in 2019. I cannot fathom what 10 year old computer running Ubuntu 12.04.1 is hosting this trash.

### UX/UI

The user experience of this website is sub par. It's hard to use, there are many menus to click through, and it's messy.
It's appalling to look at, with the menus requiring a whole page reload. technologies exist to make this easier to do, but it's so
archaic the poor old computer I use cannot stand it.

### Ads

Ohhhhh boy. This site has more ads than pornhub. It's actually impossible to use this website without adblock, which makes it completely unfundable. I get that you need to pay the bills, but the extremes taken here are absolutely outrageous. You could get away fine with a 20 dollar VPS from digital ocean, and it would handle the bulk of your issues easily. The amount of ads you have are _probably_ making a lot more than 20 dollars when they aren't being blocked. Those ads are probably a security vulnerability in it of itself. Disgusting. I hope to see an improvement soon.
